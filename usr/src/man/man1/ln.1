.Op Ar target_file

.Nm
.Op Fl fns

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.
In the first synopsis form, the
.Nm
utility creates a new directory entry
(link) for the file specified by
.Ar source_file ,
at the destination path specified by
.Ar target_file .
If
.Ar target_file
is not specified, the link is made in the current directory.
This first synopsis form is assumed when the final
operand does not name an existing directory; if more than two operands are
specified and the final is not an existing directory, an error will result.
.Lp
In the second synopsis form, the
.Nm
utility creates a new directory entry for each file specified by a
.Ar source_file
operand, at a destination path with the same file name as
.Ar source_file ,
in the existing directory named by
.Ar target_dir .
.Lp
The
.Nm
utility may be used to create both hard links and symbolic links.
A hard link is a pointer to a file and is indistinguishable from the original
directory entry.
Any changes to a file are effective independent of the name
used to reference the file.
Hard links may not span file systems and may not
refer to directories.
.Lp
The
.Nm
utility by default creates hard links.
.Lp
If the destination is an existing file and the
.Fl f
option is not specified,
.Nm
will write a diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more
with the current
.Ar source_file ,
and go on to any remaining
.Ar source_file Ns No s.
.Lp
A symbolic link is an indirect pointer to a file; its directory entry
contains the name of the file to which it is linked.
Symbolic links may span file systems and may refer to directories.
.Lp
File permissions for
.Ar target
may be different from those displayed with an
.Fl l
listing of the
.Xr ls 1
command.
To display the permissions of
.Ar target ,
use
.Ic ls Fl lL .
See
.Xr stat 2
for more information.
.Lp
When creating a hard link, and the source file is itself a symbolic link, the
target will be a hard link to the file referenced by the symbolic link, not to
the symbolic link object itself
.Pq Ar source_file ,
unless the
.Fl P
flag is present.
.
.Sh OPTIONS
.
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
If the destination file already exists,
.Nm
attempts to
.Xr unlink 2
the file before, making the new link.
If this fails,
.Nm
prints a diagnostic message to
.Va stderr
and moves to the next
.Ar source_file ,
if any remain.
.
.It Fl s
Create symbolic links.
The
.Ar source_file Ns No Pq s
may be any path name and need not exist.
The
.Fl P
and
.Fl L
options are ignored if this option is present.
.
.It Fl L
.
If
.Ar source_file
names a symbolic link, then the
.Ar target
will be linked to the file that symbolic link
.Ar source_file ,
references.
This is the default behavior, and is the inverse of
.Fl P .
This option is ignored if
.Fl s
is present.
.
.It Fl P
.
If
.Ar source_file
names a symbolic link, then the destination
will be linked to the symbolic link
.Ar source_file
itself.
This is the inverse of
.Fl L .
This option is ignored if
.Fl s
is present.
.
.It Fl n
.
This option is present for legacy compatability only, and is ignored.
.El
.
.Lp
If both
.Fl F
and
.Fl P
options are present, then the last one specified determines the
behavior of
.Nm .
.
.Sh OPERANDS
.
The following operands are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar source_file
A path name of a file to be linked.
This can be either a regular or special file.
If the
.Fl s
option is specified,
.Ar source_file
can also be a directory.
.
.It Ar target_file
The path name of the new directory entry to be created.
.
.It Ar target_dir
The path name of an existing
directory in which the new directory entries are to be created.
.El
.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.
See
.Xr environ 5
for descriptions of the following environment variables
that affect the execution of
.Nm :
.Dv LANG , LC_ALL , LC_CTYPE , LC_MESSAGES , No and Dv NLSPATH .
.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.
.Ex -std
.
.Sh CODE SET INDEPENDENCE
.
.Sy Enabled .
.
.Sh INTERFACE STABILITY
.
.Sy Standard .
However the
.Fl n
is a local extension, and is
.Sy Committed .
.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.
.Xr chmod 1 ,
.Xr ls 1 ,
.Xr stat 2 ,
.Xr environ 5 ,
.Xr standards 5
.
.Sh NOTES
A symbolic link to a directory behaves differently than you might expect in
certain cases.
While an
.Xr ls 1
command on such a link displays the files
in the pointed-to directory, entering
.Ic ls Fl l
displays information about the link itself:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
example% \fBln -s dir link\fR
example% \fBls link\fR
file1 file2 file3 file4
example% \fBls -l link\fR
lrwxrwxrwx  1 user            7 Jan 11 23:27 link -> dir
.Ed
.Lp
When you change to a directory
Pq see Xr cd 1
through a symbolic link, using
.Pa /usr/bin/sh
or
.Pa /usr/bin/csh ,
you wind up in the pointed-to location
within the file system. This means that the parent of the new working directory
is not the parent of the symbolic link, but rather, the parent of the
pointed-to directory. This will also happen when using
.Ic cd
with the
.Fl P
option from
.Pa /usr/bin/ksh
or
.Pa /usr/xpg4/bin/sh .
For
instance, in the following case, the final working directory is
.Pa /usr
and not
.Pa /home/user/linktest .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
example% \fBpwd\fR
/home/user/linktest
example% \fBln -s /usr/tmp symlink\fR
example% \fBcd symlink\fR
example% \fBcd .\|.\fR
example% \fBpwd\fR
.Ed
.Lp
C shell users can avoid any resulting navigation problems by using the
.Ic pushd
and
.Ic popd
built-in commands instead of
.Ic cd .
